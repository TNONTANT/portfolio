# [Project 1: A Data Science Investigation of Nurses Stress Dataset](https://github.com/TNONTANT/Detecting-Stress-with-Wearable-Watch-Sensors/tree/main) 
A data science project examining the impact of biometric signals on stress levels in nurses. Developing a data pipeline and machine learning model to predict stress in real-world scenarios.

# [Project 2: Neural Network from scratch](https://github.com/TNONTANT/Neural-net-from-scratch-Lunar-landing)
This project builds a neural network model from scratch to make autonomous gameplay in the Landing Rocket game, without external libraries, to gain a deep understanding of deep learning concepts. Collected data is used, and essential components like feedforward and backpropagation are implemented. It enhances comprehension of the underlying principles behind deep learning.
